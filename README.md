## Technical

* Ruby version: 2.3.0

* System dependencies

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite:

- Download locally, ensure Postgres is running, then from the directory you downloaded, type 'rails s' into your Terminal window.

## Description

Runpublic is an app that was created for runners to be able to track their progress while training and to be able to comment on one another's running achievements and goals.

Record your run on the main page, create an account, and track your progress every time you run.

## Stretch Goals

- Deploy to Heroku or Cloud 9

- Configuring the database for user accounts and logins (devise)

- Associate Runs with Users (one User to many Runs) so that each User can only edit their own Runs. Create a new page that shows only the current User's Runs.

- Add the ability to embed a GIF in a Comment.

- Associate a Comment with the User who made it, so that you can see all comments made by a given User.

## Difficulties

- Not enough support from instructors while we were working on bulk of project over the weekend - especially from Derek. Must keep in mind how new we are to this :)

- Building the PostgresQL database models the correct way

- Populating new items into the database from the Javascript stop timer

- Configuring routes/controllers/models correctly

- Local issues between the project partners (/runs worked on Joy's machine, but not Eden's)

- Project workflow for a brand new framework proved to be very difficult
